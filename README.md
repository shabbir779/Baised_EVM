# Baised_EVM
This project depicts the EVM machine used for electoral voting but there's a twist which deviates the EVM from usual behaviour.
You can vote in legal way only 5 votes. From 6th vote onwards every vote will go to a particular party.
You can change the voting conditions in the source code to vote for particular party of ur choice.
